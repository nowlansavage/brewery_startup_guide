# The Brewer’s Startup Guide: A Beer Industry Market Analysis
## Introduction
With more and more craft breweries popping up everyday, it is important to stay on top of the Beer industry market in order to stay ahead or to start up a new brewery. In this project we aim to create a tool that will help brewers visualize the craft beer industry geographically as well as by consumer preference. Visualizations will be created to display hotspots of craft breweries and also highlight where there is potential growth for the craft beer industry. We will also aim to visualize customer preferences in beer. Are there certain styles that get more or higher ratings? What about abv and location? This tool will help craft breweries make informed decisions about the beers they make and where they open their breweries.

## How we aim to do this
We will use our database created from the previous ETL project. We will use JS to create an interactive dashboard to display the previously mentioned visualization. We will use HTML and bootstrap css to make the dashboard itself. 


## Data Sources:
Rate Beer - Webscrape
Brewers’ Association - Webscrape 
Census Data

## Visualizations


## Repo
The code for the framework of the website is in **index.html**. The database itself is **beer_project.sqlite** this is connected using a flask app in **app.py**. The CSS files are in the CSS folder and the vizulaizations are populated using **chart.js** in the js folder.
